Right at the start of human consciousness, we express our creativity and try to conceptualize the world around us (back as earlier as 30,000 BCE). Archeologists discovery is in the material sense. The ideologies, ritual, practice is forever lost and up to the interpretation. As humans, we need to shelter ourselves. It could be that we simplify reality into symbolic representations, classify, categories, make it understandable so that the group can work towards the same goal? Or it could be that we need meaning in our lives and resorting to some divinity is inevitable. </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs in Chornlogical Order </p><ul><li>Ritual drama before briuel </li><li>Animal can be reborn from its bone (The Jerusalem Bible) </li><li>Religion of the cave </li><li>Shamanism during the Paleolithic period </li><li>Female &amp; Males geometric signs (Leroi-Gourhan)</li><li>Paleolithic signs and figures represent stories (Marshak)</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is James Tsui from Singapore. Over here, we have conscription, so I’m serving my 2 years of National Service. Before that, I was doing my diploma in Business Informatics at Nanyang Polytechnic. I can programme, especially javascript stuff — been participating in hackathon to further my skills and expose myself into the startup ecosystem. Right now I’m contemplating about life, a shared endeavour of people roughly the same age as me. So that was this website for. To contemplate. Here’s a summary I wrote a few months ago in case I were to create a platform to share my thought </p><p>I’m using this platform to formulate my throughs. I realised that understanding a topic implicitly and expressing it explicitly are two different nature. The problem for me when trying to explain something is 1. there were gaps in my knowledge 2. the other individual has a pre-supposition that is different from mine.</p>]]></content>
