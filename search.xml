        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The question I want to contend with is that of human rationality. First, we have the define our terminology. What do we mean by rationality? I lack the knowledge of the philosophical perspective of rationality so I need to catch up on that in the future, but let us define rationality in terms in game theory. There are several axioms in game theory, but as a summary; if I get to choose between $1 and $2, I should pick $2 … obviously. The same logic should be applied to other scenarios or object with our initial logic. There might be a few problems here. Is this the same as Aristotelian’s logic? And what is the evolution of logic theory? Does the example suffice?</p><p>We can define rationally from another perspective. As conscience being, we are in control of our behaviour. There’s some problem with the definition here. We can say that there is a pre-define morality in every one of us that may be relative/absolute (We are not here to discuss this) or to put it in Kantian terms, a priori morality. Another view would be the existentialist view where it rejects the Kantian theory and expresses itself as existence before essence, men define men itself. We are responsible for our creation even though our environment, and psychological factor affects our behaviour, we choose our action and how we went to define ourselves. (Jean-Paul Sartre) Let’s say that our definition can compress all this view.</p><p>But we know for sure that sometimes our emotions can overcome our rationality. It may be the case where I’m angry and choose to have a lose-lose situation, but what I’m a referencing to is beyond that. Sometimes, we act against our will or something we act without thinking of the consequences. From the psychoanalysis (Freudian?)/Nietzschean view, we have to contend with our desires. It runs deep into our soul and springs out whenever it gets suppressed to a certain extent. Not only are we rational, but we are also irrational. We have contend to with Dionysus.</p><p>Here’s is where I turn to a more pragmatic view. We can build AI (artificial intelligence) in two different ways; the rule-based (ontological) or the pattern-based way (epistemology). We can look at the history of AI; the rule-based approach is unable to comprehend overly complicated problem because there are too many factors to consider (NP-Problem) and there are other subtle factors that are we’re not aware. We have resorted to the machine learning pattern-based approach. The problem lies on how to counter the inevitability of irrationally. How do we guide the machine to refute the probability of irrationally when we don’t understand consciousness ourselves? We can scale the problem down as a probability model on human behaviour, but our behaviour is a subset of our consciousness, we still need to tackle this problem, although it might not be a serious one now, it will be when we expect AI machine to run the world in the future.</p><p>Further Research/Reading </p><ul><li>Aristotle’s Logic </li><li>Post-Aristotle Classical Rationalism</li><li>Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy - the dichotomy of Apollonian and Dionysian</li><li>Psychology of human behavior?</li><li>Psychology of irrationality?</li><li>Irrationality in game theory</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Paleanthropians"><a href="#Paleanthropians" class="headerlink" title="Paleanthropians"></a>Paleanthropians</h3><p>We should not underestimate the development of religious idea. Right at the start of human consciousness, we express our creativity and try to conceptualize the world around us (back as earlier as 30,000 BCE). Archeologists discovery is in the material sense. The ideologies, ritual, practice is forever lost and up to the interpretation. As humans, we need to shelter ourselves. It could be that we simplify reality into symbolic representations, classify, categories, make it understandable so that the group can work towards the same goal? Or it could be that we need meaning in our lives and resorting to some divinity is inevitable. </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>Ritual drama before briuel </li><li>Animal can be reborn from its bone (The Jerusalem Bible) </li><li>Religion of the cave </li><li>Shamanism during the Paleolithic period </li><li>Female &amp; Males geometric signs (Leroi-Gourhan)</li><li>Paleolithic signs and figures represent stories (Marshak)</li></ul><h3 id="Agriculture-Mesolithic-and-Neolithic"><a href="#Agriculture-Mesolithic-and-Neolithic" class="headerlink" title="Agriculture- Mesolithic and Neolithic"></a>Agriculture- Mesolithic and Neolithic</h3><p>The Ice Age (8000 BCE) marks the transition into the Agricultural era where human moved to the domestication of animal and farming. Human’s creativity leads to the creation of new tools for cultivation. However, unlike today’s rational and empirical era, human attach mythological association to their figurative or geometric creations. There’s a divergence in society as human escape the confound of the cave and explore into different regions. Maybe it’s due to the limitation in our capacity to organise ourselves. At a certain threshold, groups split into different groups as they choose to cooperate or fight one another when encountered. </p><p>The idea of dichotomy can be found here where it probably has a cosmological meaning (sky and earth, masculine and feminine, etc.). This thinking has manifested itself in today’s philosophy as well. What worries me is the post-structuralist way where everything can be deconstructed and redefined. Is it possible that we could transcend our pre-modern thinking, or will it lead to a regression? (To further research) </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>The first military organisation took shape as guardian or hunters </li><li>Raw meat eaters (Omophagia - worship of Dionysus)</li><li>Myth of Hainuwele </li><li>Female rise in social position as they are responsible for the mysteries of creation in harvesting (Hera’s mythology)</li><li>The Cosmic Tree Mythology (Life-Death-PostExistence)</li><li>Construction of temples and family chapel (Jericho)</li><li>Cult of skulls </li></ul><h3 id="Iron-Age"><a href="#Iron-Age" class="headerlink" title="Iron Age"></a>Iron Age</h3><p>The creation of furnace brings an evolution in mythological and religious thinking. Back in the agriculture era, human worship the earth as Mother Nature and the source of harvesting. It is where the origin of life comes to be (association with the Mother’s womb). The caves and mines are a representation of the womb of Mother Earth. For metallurgy, the creation of the furnace opens up the new job possibility; the blacksmith. Now, human can perfect the ore, which means in a cosmological sense, men are now responsible for the creation of men. This can be interpreted as such; where the divine smiths forge the weapons of the gods and slay the dragon. In Egyptian version of the myth, Ptah (the potter god) forges the weapons and enable Hocus to conquer Seth. Hephaestus forges the thunderbolt that will enable Zeus to triumph over Typhon. The divine smith Tastr makes Indra’s weapons for his battle with Vrtra. This shift is ideas and beliefs are articulated around the trades of miners, metallurgists and smiths</p><h3 id="The-Mesopotamian-Religions"><a href="#The-Mesopotamian-Religions" class="headerlink" title="The Mesopotamian Religions"></a>The Mesopotamian Religions</h3><p>The Sumerian is said to be the earliest civilisation to document their myth. Here we have a story of the Enuma Elish where Dr Jordon Peterson used for his construction of symbolic representation in his book “Maps of Meaning”. The story flows like this: Tiamat (femininity) and Apsu(masculinity) are the primordial beings, representing the sea and mass of fresh water. From their mixture, other divine beings were born. As times passes, the tension grew between the gods and Apsu was executed. Tiamet reacted by forming monsters and bestow Kingu as their leader. Fearing defeat, the gods resort on sacrificing their power to rely on Marduk to confront Tiamat and Kingu. Marduk won the battle and created the world out of Tiamat’s organ. Finally, Maruk decides to create mankind from his blood for mankind shall service the gods.  </p><p>At Babylon, civilisation performs ritual closely resembling the Enuma Elish. With reference from Dr Jordan Peterson, civilisation forms into a hierarchy, but strangely the king is never at the top. He is still subordinate to the gods. On the day of a New Year, he expiates himself by declaring his innocence and is rewarded with a hierodule personifying as the goddess, metaphorically meaning the recreation of the world. The king is the personification of the gods that acts as a mediator between the world of men and the world of gods.</p><p>Here we can track the evolution of the religious idea. The Neolithic influences the Sumerian to an extent in terms of the patterns/narrative of the belief, and it’s passed further down to Greece thinking. The patterns stayed similar. However, the characters of the story defer. Why is that? (En-lil during Mesopotamia &gt; Marduk during Babylon &gt; Shamash) </p><p>Questioning the mythological is it uncertainly whether the idea of the dichotomy of (using Christians term) heaven and hell existed before the Mesopotamian or during this period.</p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>Enuma Elish </li><li>The Platonic Idea - preexistence of words and institutions </li><li>Flood Myth to symbolises a New Year (Story of Noah)</li><li>Epic of Gilgamesh</li></ul>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is James Tsui from Singapore. Over here, we have conscription, so I’m serving my 2 years of National Service. Before that, I was doing my diploma in Business Informatics at Nanyang Polytechnic. I can programme, especially javascript stuff — been participating in hackathon to further my skills and expose myself into the startup ecosystem. Right now I’m contemplating about life, a shared endeavour of people roughly the same age as me. So that was this website for. To contemplate. Here’s a summary I wrote a few months ago in case I were to create a platform to share my thought </p><p>I’m using this platform to formulate my throughs. I realised that understanding a topic implicitly and expressing it explicitly are two different nature. The problem for me when trying to explain something is 1. there were gaps in my knowledge 2. the other individual has a pre-supposition that is different from mine.</p>]]></content>
