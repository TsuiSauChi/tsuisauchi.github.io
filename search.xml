        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h3 id="Paleanthropians"><a href="#Paleanthropians" class="headerlink" title="Paleanthropians"></a>Paleanthropians</h3><p>We should not underestimate the development of religious idea. Right at the start of human consciousness, we express our creativity and try to conceptualize the world around us (back as earlier as 30,000 BCE). Archeologists discovery is in the material sense. The ideologies, ritual, practice is forever lost and up to the interpretation. As humans, we need to shelter ourselves. It could be that we simplify reality into symbolic representations, classify, categories, make it understandable so that the group can work towards the same goal? Or it could be that we need meaning in our lives and resorting to some divinity is inevitable. </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>Ritual drama before briuel </li><li>Animal can be reborn from its bone (The Jerusalem Bible) </li><li>Religion of the cave </li><li>Shamanism during the Paleolithic period </li><li>Female &amp; Males geometric signs (Leroi-Gourhan)</li><li>Paleolithic signs and figures represent stories (Marshak)</li></ul><h3 id="Agriculture-Mesolithic-and-Neolithic"><a href="#Agriculture-Mesolithic-and-Neolithic" class="headerlink" title="Agriculture- Mesolithic and Neolithic"></a>Agriculture- Mesolithic and Neolithic</h3><p>The Ice Age (8000 BCE) marks the transition into the Agricultural era where human moved to the domestication of animal and farming. Human’s creativity leads to the creation of new tools for cultivation. However, unlike today’s rational and empirical era, human attach mythological association to their figurative or geometric creations. There’s a divergence in society as human escape the confound of the cave and explore into different regions. Maybe it’s due to the limitation in our capacity to organise ourselves. At a certain threshold, groups split into different groups as they choose to cooperate or fight one another when encountered. </p><p>The idea of dichotomy can be found here where it probably has a cosmological meaning (sky and earth, masculine and feminine, etc.). This thinking has manifested itself in today’s philosophy as well. What worries me is the post-structuralist way where everything can be deconstructed and redefined. Is it possible that we could transcend our pre-modern thinking, or will it lead to a regression? (To further research) </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>The first military organisation took shape as guardian or hunters </li><li>Raw meat eaters (Omophagia - worship of Dionysus)</li><li>Myth of Hainuwele </li><li>Female rise in social position as they are responsible for the mysteries of creation in harvesting (Hera’s mythology)</li><li>The Cosmic Tree Mythology (Life-Death-PostExistence)</li><li>Construction of temples and family chapel (Jericho)</li><li>Cult of skulls </li></ul><h3 id="Iron-Age"><a href="#Iron-Age" class="headerlink" title="Iron Age"></a>Iron Age</h3><p>The creation of furnace brings an evolution in mythological and religious thinking. Back in the agriculture era, human worship the earth as The Mother Nature as the source of harvesting. It is where the origin of life comes to be (association with the Mother’s womb). The caves and mines are a representation of the womb of Mother Earth. For metallurgy, the creation of the furnace opens up the job possibility; the blacksmith. Now, human can perfect the ore, which means in a cosmological sense, men are now responsible for the creation of men. This can be intrepredted as such; where the divine smiths forge the weapons of the gods and slay the dragon. In Egyptian version of the myth, Ptah (the potter god) forges the weapons and enable Hocus to conquer Seth. Hephaestus forges the thunderbolt that will enable Zeus to triumph over Typhon. The divine smith Tastr makes Indra’s weapons for his battle with Vrtra. This shift is ideas and beliefs are articulated around the trades of miners, metallurgists and smiths </p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello. My name is James Tsui from Singapore. Over here, we have conscription, so I’m serving my 2 years of National Service. Before that, I was doing my diploma in Business Informatics at Nanyang Polytechnic. I can programme, especially javascript stuff — been participating in hackathon to further my skills and expose myself into the startup ecosystem. Right now I’m contemplating about life, a shared endeavour of people roughly the same age as me. So that was this website for. To contemplate. Here’s a summary I wrote a few months ago in case I were to create a platform to share my thought </p><p>I’m using this platform to formulate my throughs. I realised that understanding a topic implicitly and expressing it explicitly are two different nature. The problem for me when trying to explain something is 1. there were gaps in my knowledge 2. the other individual has a pre-supposition that is different from mine.</p>]]></content>
