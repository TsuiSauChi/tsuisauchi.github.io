        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There is a mystery element within our consciousness that we are unaware, objective categories manifest within the mind itself which bind to the very subject of experience. Before Kant rise to prominence, <a href="https://tsuisauchi.github.io/2019/10/06/On-Hume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">David Hume distinguishes our innate ability to recognise the causation of objects as uniform repetition closest to determinate truth</a>. Still, he left out the question of the medium which brings the cause and effect as a unified proposition. How is it possible to cognise the concepts of causality in the first place. Immanuel Kant awoke from his dogmatic slumber after reading Hume. Shaken into a state of limbo for 13 years, before publishing his magnum-opus, on the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18288.Critique_of_Pure_Reason" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Critique of Pure Reasons</a>, changing the trajectory of philosophy towards a new era.</p><a id="more"></a><p>There are two angles to look at propositions. Firstly, to dissect it analytically. In the proposition “God is Being”, we take the sentence as a whole and look within, breaking it down tautologically. The predicate is contained in the subject. The second way is to consider the proposition synthetically, where “God” the subject, and “Being” the predicate, lies separate from one another. Then expanded and add together into one proposition. Sort of like an act of creation. The latter is Kants focus. He wanted to know how synthetic proposition possible without experience, without the mediation of any object beforehand. Similar to imagining being in a blank state, having all sensory organ torn from us, then to conceive some reality by building proposition solely from the mind. After all, if Descartes manage to construct his principles from such an imaginative state, it must be possible.</p><p>Consider mathematics, how is 5 + 6 equals to 11 possible? How are causality and science possible? What is the medium that brings these synthetic propositions together? And is the answer implicit in the two questions brought forth to metaphysics? Hume concludes that metaphysics is merely borrowed from experiences through habit. This argument would destroy pure mathematics and theoretical natural science such as the permanence of quality of matter, inertia, of equality of action and reaction.</p><h3 id="Of-Intuition"><a href="#Of-Intuition" class="headerlink" title="Of Intuition"></a>Of Intuition</h3><p>Kant coherent system begins with intuition. Firstly,to perceive is to mediate through the external principle of space. Only with space, we can have presentation of any object in their outer appearances. Space has to be an innate objective principle, a priori within the mind. If we were to dismiss space as an independent concept underlying outward appearance with subjective perception, then not only is experiences subjective but so is mathematics without any objective grounds. The intuition of space must reside in the subject for the synthesis concept such as Geometric to exist objectively, not deducible from any empirical or experiential object but rather a priori from our mind. We can cognise space outside the use of sensibility, treating it as a thing in itself, not correlated with the empirical appearance of presentation. Secondly, perceiving requires the subject to mediate, and the sequential principle of time must exist together with the simultaneous intuition of space. With the infinite magnitude of time itself, we derive concept of finite concept such as Calculus. We could abstract all sensible intuition from time, and what is left is time is nothing by itself but only as a mode for mediation. Thus, the internal relation of time and the perceivable external space must be empirically real but without the subject and object of mediation is just empty concepts - differs from Newton who states that time and space are external universal concept outside of human experiences.<br>We can associate time and space to give the determinate answer that pure mathematics is possible because time and space exist for us a priori for the synthetic judgement.  ‘5 + 6’ equals ‘11’ through the intuition of time and space between the mediation of subject and object. We can posit further now and ask the question “How is empirical judgement and our ability to understand possible? </p><h3 id="Of-Understanding"><a href="#Of-Understanding" class="headerlink" title="Of Understanding"></a>Of Understanding</h3><p>Uncovering a priori concept of logic of empirical judgement requires us to attempt to abstract empirical judgement itself. For such judgement is built on the intuition of the subject through the object with the unity of space and time. How does intuition posit itself and reach into understanding? The a priori principle must be contained within the boundaries of sensibility and to dissect within with the practice of analytic cognition. The ability of our senses allows us to understand the world around us and to conduct empirical experience. But the same understanding]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a> innate in us also comes with the ability to reason into uncharted grounds. Any venture beyond the analytic will be as the Greeks called ]<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">4</a>the term ‘Dialectic’.

Furthermore, the scholasticism (medieval age) added commentary upon commentary on top of Artistole’s work, an absurd amount of overinterpretation. The Greeks and Medievalist use the formal categories to infer proposition with the presupposition of a higher deity. The carelessness of the scholastics takes the dogmatic categories as given to us. Any non-experiential transcendence concept can be thus taken as true.<br>But with:<br>1) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copernican_Revolution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Copernican revolution</a> shifting the paradigm of thinking - that we resolve the world instead of the world around us.<br>2) <a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/descartes/1639/meditations.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Descartes (1596-1650 CE)</a> further inverse-ment of the medieval thinking with the start of first-principles.]<br>3) <a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/locke/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">John Locke (1632–1704 CE)</a> distinguishing between the nature of reality and our ability to grasp it.]</p><p>Kant’s work is to redefine the pirori categories with the synthesis of Stochasticism and Modernity. The categories must be an objective formal principle to infer things maternally, grounded in experiences, and always relating to the sensible object as a group for logical reasoning.</p><p>We hold the two a pirori categories of intuition; of space and time. We can now posit further regarding the phenomenon of the object - the synthesis of imagination regarding the concept of the understanding about the object.<br>First, the unity of intuition gives way to the axioms of certain mathematical or numerical formula such as Geometry and Numbers. We use these forms of magnitude/quantity to cognise further mathematical propositions, from parts to a whole, through the cognition of successive synthesis. We shall call this the schema of magnitude/quantity in time series.<br>Second, we can take a magnitude as a whole - as 1, then work towards complete negation - as 0. The content of appearance for sensibility is constraints within a boundary of space and time for empirical inquiry. We choose that boundary, whether consciously or unconsciously between the void and reality. We call this the schema of quality in time content.<br>Third, we consider experience, as a unity of formal intuition and material perception under one consciousness. Unlike the previous two principles where we can determine a magnitude and therefore is mathematically deducible, experience is different. Experience is to use causality as a system to regulate but purely subjective. We call this a schema of relation in time order.<br>Lastly, we take the unity the unity of the 3 principles to explicate about its empirical use. Synthesis of the imagination with no base in preception and no reference to any object is only possible. Arbitrary formed in conjunction. What is perceived as a material object is Actual. And to recognise the change of state from the cause to effect is considered to be a necessity. </p><h3 id="The-Sensible-and-the-Noumenal"><a href="#The-Sensible-and-the-Noumenal" class="headerlink" title="The Sensible and the Noumenal"></a>The Sensible and the Noumenal</h3><p>With the completion of the categories, we have to make a distinction between the sensible and noumenal world. We have the categories for pure sensibility - quantity and quality - that is subjected to the of analytic judgement, of the laws of contradiction. We also have the categories for pure understanding - relation and its unity. The rules of analytic do not apply here if we were to enquire beyond the appearance of the object, into the noumenal world, into the things-in-themselves. The categories exist innate us as a formal category for us to interact with the world, to discover but still bounded by experience. The line of reasoning to enquiry into the beyond is given to us by our experience, therefore has to be taken as an unattainable. There could be things outside the sense but never perceivable by us, no matter how we try to reason. But yet, we have the innate categories of the understanding to undertake such a task. If so, how is metaphysics in general possible? How can we as individual hope for the future? </p>]]></content>

      <title>On Hume</title>
      <link href="/2019/10/06/On-Hume/"/>
      <url>/2019/10/06/On-Hume/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hume lived in the period of the enlightenment where (to put it simplicity) the stage of philosophy battle is between the rationalist and the empiricist prevails. Hume would position himself as a sceptical empiricist, qualifying as one of the big three on the side of the empiricist. He dismisses the rationalist as too abstract and un-practical. Our imagination is too limitless, able to access into the realm beyond the universe in our mind and travel into uncharted chaos. But we need to ground ourselves back into reality. </p><a id="more"></a><p>Imagine this example. I make a clear and concise proposition that is based on preceding propositions; thus, we get a sequential flow of propositions that makes sense and is logically acceptable. Unlike mathematics, that always has a determine answer, my proposition is based on my ability to rationalize from my thoughts or experiences, but there is always open to arbitrariness and obscurity.<br>We can look at a conceptual example of democracy. How can we define democracy? I could look at history, and I could look at the words that outline the definition, I could look compare different forms of democracy, and I should say that there is a certain degree of democracy. From this, we split democracy further into different types; representative democracy, liquid democracy, etcetera.<br>The genus may differ from each other in appearances, and some species may be subordinate to each other, until Ad Infinium. What is implies is that to compare different definition would eventually lead us in absolute contradiction.<br>Hume prefers something more consistent, and less contradictory, something less abstract and more relatable, something more determinate and certain. We need to rely on our senses and experiences.  </p><p>Questioning every method of enquires leads us down the path of being a sceptic. But one shouldn’t stay within the realm of Cartesian Doubt for too long, no durable good can ever result from it. To doubt everything to its core is to reject everything, unable to act. Eventually, nature will consume our miserable existence. We need to find a way out. But how? Hume’s solution is to simplify experience into easily recognizable terms, into three constructs; Resemblance, Contiguity and Causality.<br>Hume claims that there should be a narrow set of interpretation through our sequential flow of reasoning to decrease our margin of error. Thus, it is impossible because every claim we make about the future, no matter how reasonable, is based on our speculation and probability on a limited set of factors. 1) When we interact with objects through our senses, we merely touch upon the object’s appearance in a particular space and time. There are attributes beneath the surface of the object’s appearance that are unknown to us until we can make senses of them. I can tell that my stress ball is a particular shade of blue, but I won’t know the density of the ball until I squeeze it. 2) When an object interacts with another object, I can tell the causality between the two objects because I experienced it. It is an object’s appearance interacting with another object’s appearance and is mutually exclusive in some space and time. 3) When I experienced a repetition of the same movement between the two objects with a uniform effect, I may be able to make predication regarding the same movement when it occurs in the future.<br>But I cannot make this certainty about the future. It is only because I have experienced the uniform repetition that I can make this claim that manifest in my habit. The interpretation I make, even if still at the level of obscurity, is closer to being deterministic, compared to the uncontrolled notion of rationality. </p><p>Hume uses the same model of causality to explain his concept of liberty. He has a strict determinist view. Liberty is incompatible with necessity. Necessity reflects on the uniformity of appearance through consistent repetition. What is uniform can be explained with culture, age, gender, traditions, etcetera. We can use the influence of necessity to conclude the future, subjected to possible errors of inferred appearances. Liberty lies in the potentiality of appearances, by the illusion that that is more to human than in a restricted set of appearances that is predictable. This can be explained on Hume’s view on reward and punishment. Animals can be controlled by appealing to their belief and instinct, but we humans, although we share both belief and instinct, we are not limited by their capacity for reasoning. We can go beyond the boundaries of the present. We can hope for the future.</p>]]></content>

      <title>My View on Hong Kong&#39;s Situation</title>
      <link href="/2019/10/06/My-View-on-Hong-Kong-s-Situation/"/>
      <url>/2019/10/06/My-View-on-Hong-Kong-s-Situation/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Its tough looking at the situation in Hong Kong. There’s so much suffering, and it deeply affects me personally - part of my roots are from Hong Kong. There seems to be no way out of the turmoil. I can’t bring myself to think politically, because if I were to engage with it at that level, I have to pick a side, and both sides seem to be a losing battle; between pro-democracy and pro-China. </p><p>The way I see it, one of the explanations of the resulting situation is social inequality, but that answer leads to no end. The empirical evidence on inequality is quite clear, that the only viable compression to long-term inequality is through violent means; Warfare, State Failure, Pandemics and Revolution. To say revolution in Hong Kong as an inevitable consequence of human nature is such a pessimistic answer. The same as saying that there’s nothing we could do but let the patterns of history play itself out again. :(</p><p>I have to view it form another perceptive, as a socially constructed phenomenon. That in appearances, it curious why there seem to be only two groups in opposition, pro-democracy and pro-China. From a macrocosm perspective, the two groups seem to be a battle between Western values against the Eastern values. If we were to trace their philosophy, the two would share different first-principles. The former from rationality since the Greek period, and the latter from moral virtue in Confucianism, and both build their empire from different grounds, constructing different approaches and progression.<br>Once the existing structure is dramatically shifted in the case of integrating China into westernizes Hong Kong, chaos will occur. The human’s belief is shaken and immediately relies on its defence mechanism.</p><p>Currently, we see both sides in the extreme form leading to the outbreaks of violence. Riots being emphasized in the news outlet and social media, leading to more tension at an international level. The world is spectating, picking a side as well.<br>But I prefer to be optimistic, there should and could a more hopeful alternative. Being a socially constructed phenomenon, it is possible to choose a new moment, a synthesis of the two. I see it as a humanitarian movement, of the position that violence as a means cannot justify whatever end. It could be an opportunity for people of Hong Kong to spark a third movement, to re-establish whatever small hope of peace left in Hong Kong. To accept the current state of oppression but to hold it back, and internalize it for the moment, and to work towards their sense of justice incrementally and widely deem acceptable from both sides. That I see, is the only positive way out of the mess, although working it through is complicated and I have no definite answers. </p>]]></content>

      <title>Liberal Confucianism</title>
      <link href="/2019/08/29/Confucianism/"/>
      <url>/2019/08/29/Confucianism/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Confucianism is a philosophy practised in the East, written obscurely by Confucious himself and his student as a guide to the Way of the Tao. The reason for his obscurity is that the interpretation of the writing is multi-dimensional; each point is in relation to each other. I’ll take my hermeneutics from the book, <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20205120-confucius" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A guide for the perplexed</a>, quoting from the author, Yong Huang, a liberal view on Confucianism. I’ll draw comparisons from the Western philosophy to make some distinction as well.</p><a id="more"></a><p>The general consensus in Western Philosophy is our ability to be rational, which makes us different from animals. The Ancient Greek Philosopher Socrates, Plato &amp; Aristotle share this common foundation. Confucianism takes a different approach in the East. The foundation of how man differs from beast is through moral virtue. In appearance, one can conclude that moral virtue is towards a collective morality. I’ll try to expand and outline the idea of what it means to be virtuous in Confucianism. The approach I’ll take is an ontological one, stating the written text in the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27297.The_Analects" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Analects</a> and explaining it circularly and symmetrically. There is a Neo-Confucianism approach -regarded as the second main stage of development in Confucianism - taking a metaphysical view of classical Confucian moral value, drawing resource from Daoism and Buddhism. But we will not be looking at this in the article.</p><p>The Analects emphasizes the importance of uprightness. <strong>In Analects 14.34, it states that the proper attitude toward wrongdoers is to repay injuries with uprightness</strong>. What this infers is to act accordingly towards the wrongdoer with the intention that the wrongdoer will change his/her behaviour for what is right. What is right isn’t explicitly clearcut, but one will know through the process of learning — learning not in the sense of the intellectual but in moral virtue.</p><blockquote><p>“By three methods we may learn wisdom: First, by reflection, which is noblest; Second, by imitation, which is easiest; and third by experience, which is the bitterest.”</p></blockquote><p>For Confucius, it is not enough to repay injuries with uprightness through and through. He/She is also responsible for the wrongdoers external and internal well-being, to ensure re-cultivation. As seen in the Western Notion of Christianity, for one to build one’s value is to do it from the standpoint of the individual, it is in my self-interest to be virtuous. Jesus attitude towards wrongdoers as he said in Matthew 5.39: But I say to you, Do not resist an evildoer. But if anyone strikes you on the right cheek, turn the other also. (Here I accept that I am taking a biased view) Confucious differs from this. Using the concept from <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/12073.Philosophical_Investigations" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wittgenstein’s language game</a>, self-interest and other-regarding are one. To care for one interest is the same as caring for others interest, vice versa. It is the two antithetical ideas combined.</p><p>The role of the government plays a huge part in Confucianism. Confucius takes an idealist approach but not utopian - since there s negative connotation to anything utopian. The role of the government is to cultivate the moral virtue of the people. <strong>“If you guide people with coercive measure and keep them in line with punishment, then they will stay out of trouble but will have no sense of shame. If you guide them with virtue and keep them in line with ritual propriety (proper conduct), then they will have a sense of shame and rectify themselves” (Analects 2.3).</strong> It is to use a structuralist view of social structure to shape the structure of motivation. If one were to conduct a nonvirtuous act, repaying that individual with uprightness, creates a sense of shame for that individual to change his/her behaviour. <strong>The use of panel punishment should be left as a last resort when recultivation should fail, but one should enforce it with sadness and compassion knowing one has failed in his/her duty to repay unrightness (Analects 19.19).</strong> This is different from the liberal and Aristotelian view. The former view the political sperate from the personal, the latter enforce legislators as moral educator through the establishment of law. Confusious view moral cultivation as everyone’s responsibility, regardless of hierarchical role, superior or inferior. </p><p>One of the more distinct moral virtue is the relationship between father and son. <strong>“Father does not disclose son’ wrongdoing, and son does not disclose father’s wrongdoing, and uprightness is in it” (Analects 13.18).</strong> The reason being is with the disclosure of the father’s wrongdoing, the father is more likely to contempt the son. It may be to the father’s external benefit but not the internal. Instead, one should gently influence the father toward uprightness. But not enough, he should also be obedient and loyal to his father in the highest regard. Using the working of self-interest = other-regarding, the cultivation of moral virtue is symmetric. But the relationship of value is more likely transmitted from superior to inferior. As said in the Analect <strong>“The Master says: At 15 I set my heart on learning, at 30 I know where I stood, at 40 I have no more doubts, at 50 I knew the will of Heaven (life’s purpose), at 60 my ears were attuned (i.e. my moral sense was developed), and at 70 I followed my heart’s desire without crossing the line.”</strong> As one grows older, one move to a higher stage in virtue until it manifest without an external rule. Age is in relation to virtue, and one should learn from those who are virtuous. </p><p>Lastly, it is appropriate to list the development of Confucianism. Since 500 B.C, Confucious lost its monopoly in China to Buddism and Neo-Daoism. We have a redevelopment of Neo-Confucianism around 12th - 16th century until the Communist Revolution. Now the main task of contemporary New Confucianism is to meet the challenges from the West arguing for the compatibility of Confucianism with science and democracy since the 1980s.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Beyond Liberty </title>
      <link href="/2019/08/29/Liberty/"/>
      <url>/2019/08/29/Liberty/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>What does it mean to be free? First and foremost, it is a word, obviously, so it must come from somewhere. According to John Locke political theory in the Age of Enlightenment, Liberty is one being free from a superpower. Adam Smith, grandfather of economy, based his entire economic theory on individual liberty. Even in the bible, the concept of liberty run strongly to the core, embedding in the logos, a spark of divinity in every man. This appearance of Western thought runs through the veins of every free individual. So strongly, in fact, it is manifested in The Bill of Rights. How unthinkable to even reject it through reason when it is Western history itself. </p><p>But even the impeccable concept is still intangible ideas. Look at Eastern Philosophy, trace back to Confucius teaching. The Western notion diffuse and differs. Men here in the Orient are men as a community. To take one’s self-interest is the same thing as the regard for others. Egoism and Altruism combined. Combined not in a way that virtuous person is partially egoistic and partially altruistic but both simultaneously. Personal and Politics circulating as one in terms of virtue ethics of the synthesis between Egoism and Altruism, that is the role of the government in the East, different from the liberal view. </p><p>To learn and understand the foundation of roots is to alienate from one’s manifestation. How am I to feel indifferent about both views. But the external is binary, to make a choice between one-another. No longer in the state of paradox left in the mind. To choose one is to reject the solid ground of an empire. How am I to decide? To view as the eye of Horus staring down at the pyramid. Now we have a split, between the above and the within, the minority and the majority, the master and the slave. Pick a side, through the guidance or multiplication.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Hegel&#39;s Introduction to the Phenomenology of Spirit</title>
      <link href="/2019/08/03/Hegel/"/>
      <url>/2019/08/03/Hegel/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit (1807) tackles the question of experience. Not ordinary experience but dialectical experience in our pursuit of absolute knowledge. The Introduction is simply a short preliminary conception, only justifiable by going through the entire book. By searching section by section, digging into the text, contemplating and re-contemplating, discovering and re-discovering, can we understand Hegel (and any book) to the fullest in a dialectical sense? </p><p>But look… still we have to start somewhere. So here’s an attempt of an introduction to the Introduction of the Phenomenology of Spirit.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><p>How do we treat the understanding of knowledge, between the relationship of our consciousness and the object of view? How do we construct the epistemological grounds of knowing? During Hegel (1770–1831) time in the 19th century, contemporary philosopher Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) published his work on The Critique of Pure Reason (1781), drawing a distinction between subject (‘I’ness) and object. The object exists in-themselves, regardless of the subject. It is we, the subject of experience, who gives the object meaning from our senses. The object exists for us, for the experiencer. Kant argues that there are properties in the object which exist in the object itself outside from our senses, in the external world. The object’s practical end is subordinate to the demands of the rational will, unable to proceed further. This concept is similar to Plato’s idea of Forms where there’s a perfection of object that transcends time and space, existing in the Realm of Forms. i.e. Forms of apple, Forms of knowledge, Forms of love, etc… Plato (429?–347 B.C.E.) accepted teaching from the pre-socratic philosopher, Pythagoras (570? to 490? BCE), positing that abstract form of mathematical objects is the ultimate truth, the perfect Form.</p><p>Hegel disagrees with the Pythagorean. Mathematics only touches the surface of the object, but it never reaches in to the depth of the lived experience. If we break a concept in Math into its inner notion, the breaking down of concept can be seen as not-true (false) because the inner notion has no relation to the concept itself. Only when put back together with the inner notion into its unity as a whole can we consider it as truth. The process of putting back together is necessary to go through with, but it cannot grasp what is left behind, it cannot grasp the synthesis of experience. Math superimposes a material sense onto self-consciousness. Hegel’s solution is the dialectical experience; the meditation between the first principle to the second principle. But to give meaning to an object, we, the phenomenological observer, need to understand the structure of consciousness. The process of inferring a logical determinateness (rational discourse) through the subject as I, to the object.</p><p>We have to reject everything to do with other belief and our own. 1) Cartesian doubt &amp; 2) Polonius Enlightenment. 3) Using Socratic scepticism position is to reject determinate interpretation and to continue contemplating and waiting for the next idea or interpretation to show up only to reject it again, leading one to take the contradictory position of nihilism. 4) An easy path out of absolute knowing is accepting the vanity of consciousness and to re-cause consciousness back to itself, pursuing a false sense of truth for its own satisfaction. </p><p>Hegel wants us to accept learning as suffering in order for us to transcend knowledge beyond consciousness own limitation. We recognize that by interacting with an object, we are entering with certain presupposition. We distinguish the object as something for consciousness and also something distinct from us. Then, how can we determine this assumption? Building from Fichte (1762–1814) concept, we start by viewing reality through the lens of the individual capacity for freedom (viewing from the lens of the object is to give the object determinism with the inability to transcend its own deduction). We have to presuppose that we are free to be conscious and use this as first principle. The ‘I’ with my consciousness of freedom view the object that is existing for consciousness but also outside of consciousness in the ‘Here’ and ‘Now’. To posit/transcend from this level, I have to do it from my consciousness. Consciousness relates to object and to itself to transcend itself. This relation is not a ‘third entity’ in the sense of Plato’s Republic nor in the Bible, but it is consciousness itself. The objectivity of the object for consciousness dissolves into subjectivity as it sinks into the level of consciousness to the level of its way of knowing it; encapsulating the infinite as finite; to bring order out of chaos, and to do it repeatedly to transcend itself from each moment. The ‘I’ freely posit itself as ‘I’. </p><p>Consciousness is not aware of its own transcendence. It is we, the phenomenological observer, behind the curtain of consciousness, who is observing the transcendence from one shape of consciousness to the next, observing its contradiction &amp; failure, its negative determinateness. Thus, for Hegel, learning is a Way of Despair; it is its own suffering. The truth or absolute knowing is the endpoint of the ladder of consciousness, where being &amp; thinking are same, being-for-consciousness &amp; the thing-in-itself are one. But by interacting with the object, the ‘otherness’ (distinctiveness properties) appears to the surface. It is no longer the truth and needs altering. Otherness exists as an innate idea, first principle and transcendental God, and it is our duty to uncover its mysteries with seriousness only to negate this knowledge in the next moment. </p><p>Experience, is a means to a means, potentially never-ending, mediating each moment. Chasing the truth in absolute darkness (or absolute lightness). </p>]]></content>

      <title>Postmodernism through a Postmodernist Lens</title>
      <link href="/2019/07/08/Critique-of-Postmodernism-through-a-Postmodernist-lens/"/>
      <url>/2019/07/08/Critique-of-Postmodernism-through-a-Postmodernist-lens/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The way we perceive the world around us has an underlying structure. That structure comes from philosophy, written by PhD professors in the past or contemporary. People adapt their liberal ideas to counter the fallacy in the previous generations. The next generation adapts those idea unconsciously. Today, with the rise of democracy and technology, we have an implosion of different ideas. Too much so that we come to accept that my truth may not be your truth. The world today is relative and subjective. You see here I’m making a very bold statement from experience and observation from the world around me that I say is true. It’s probably not until we analyze the history of philosophy.</p><a id="more"></a><p>“There is a limit to our sensibility, we cannot construe objective reality because human being experience is subjective in itself and in relation to time and space.” This is an abstract critique taken from Immanuel Kant, a revolutionary philosopher to be said to have started the postmodernist movement. To get a different sense of things, let us look at academic critique from the supporters of the Enlightenment thinkers against postmodernism. “The Postmodernist view that we could structure our society is evolutionally wrong” or “Post-structuralism view that ideas are primary construct linguistic is incorrect, there’s no way to bridge the subject and the object.” </p><p>If we look at the evolution of these mindsets, we tell that the enlightenment thinkers starting from the 15th century rejects the earlier medieval scholasticism because of the lack of rational foundation and the reliance on dogmatic teaching. Then there a change in trajectories in the 19th century, the postmodernist synthesis the teaching of scholasticism and enlightenment from the realization that we cannot rely on rational causality due to our limited cognitive capacity. We begin to reject rational and empirical thinking for a belief in faith. It could be seen as a degression to the medieval ages. </p><p>One could make these claim from looking at history, but the problem is reducing our philosophical history to a few sentences. We reduce history into their appearance and the things-in-themselves fall out of our consciousness. When you think back on a subject you learn in school, what can you remember about it? Perhaps only the outlining and critical concept on the subject-matter. For philosophy, the same happens. Fascism is bad because of Hiliter. Marxism is bad because of the Soviet Union and China. But do you know the details of each doctrine? Doesn’t matter because we can attribute them to evil.</p><p>It’s naive for us to criticizes an appearance. For example, you could reject the post-structuralist approach using evolution and biology. Society is not a linguistic structure when we have millions of years of evolution that prove otherwise. This is an incomplete argument. Let’s expand these through the eyes of a post-structurist, Michel Focualt. Foucault concludes from his research on anthropology that in each era; Ancient to Medieval to Modernity to Post-Modernity, each era view of ontology and epistemology is independent from each other, and this is reflected in the language they use to communicate. Can the former argument negates the latter when the latter is expended in detail (although still abstract-in-itself)? Not really. The case can be refuted when we categorize it monolithically. Secondly, we use a different scientific domain to critique another domain — Biology vs Linguistic. The most accurate method to refute Focualt is too out-Focualt him, but this requires intense research that could take years. This is quite impossible, especially for philosophy due to its nature of being meta-science. One could only posit ideas from refuting apparance. Or we could take Hegel approach of thesis, antithesis and synthesis where history is a lineaer regression in its totality, but looking at the mass killings in the 20th century, it doesnt seem to be the case that we are improving.</p><p>Using each view of things, one could easily reach a conclusion where the truth is relative and subjective depending on the spatial-temporal variable. Your perception could be based on how I use positive or negative connotation. But this view is one of many. My method of critique is from Kant and Hegel, through a postmodernism lense. There are other ways of reasoning too. We can take Enlightenment philosophies such as Spinoza, Newton and Leibniz, where the universe can be explain using computation and mathematics. We will reach a different conclusion then.</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Looking at inequality, we see that it is an issue in every economy. It’s a problem that we have to look that, but it’s much more complicated then you think. There are different lenses one can view from, and I’ll try to lay out some of them. </p><a id="more"></a><p>If you’re a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marxist</a>, you’ll see that <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inequality is increasing indefinitely</a>. That’s the idea in the Soviet Union. Splitting the population into proletariat and bourgeois, compressing the wealth gap by massacring about <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">60 million people</a>. One can argue that the situation is much more complicated then it seems, and it is much more complicated. To understand Marxism, one would have to understand <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Friedrich_Hegel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hegel</a> as well, and Hegel is hard to decipher. The probability that the majority of the population understanding Hegel yet alone, Marx is probably zero. </p><p><img src="/images/marixstinequality.png" alt="Inequality" title="Inequality"></p><p>If you look at <a href="http://j-bradford-delong.net/teaching_folder/Econ_210c_spring_2002/Readings/Kuznets_Inequality.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kurnet curve</a>, the period of transitioning between the agriculture era to the industrial age, you’ll see that that inequality is a U-shape curve, although future scholars have debunked that. Then we have to ask ourselves. Can we trust our empirical data to be reliable now knowing full well that it will be changed in the future?</p><p><img src="/images/kurnet.jpg" alt="Kurnet" title="Kurnet Curve"></p><p>If you look at a <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/cond-mat/0301289.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">simulated environment</a> to test the distribution of inequality, you’ll see that the equilibrium of wealth when considering the individual’s saving propsensity is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_distribution" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pareto distribution</a>. But what we have here is just theoretical.</p><p><img src="/images/pareto-wealth-graph.jpg" alt="Pareto" title="Pareto distribution"></p><p>If you look at history from the <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/31951505-the-great-leveler" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stone Age to the Twenty-First Century</a>, you see that the primary mode of inequality compression is through 4 violent means; Warfare, Revolution,  State Failure and Pandemics.<br>T<img src="/images/thegreatleveler.png" alt="History of Inequality" title="History of Inequality"></p><p>If you look at the role of the government, it is to provide policy and legislative acts to balance inequality at a desirable level. But different political tribes hold different view on this matter.</p><p><img src="/images/politicalspectrum.gif" alt="Political Spectrum" title="Political Spectrum"></p><p>If you look at inequality, are you trying to solve absolute poverty or relative wealth? What’s you’re game? Are you trying to solve a psychological issue, or are you aiming at changing the empirical economic data? </p><p>Now, you see that the problem is not as simple as you think. You can’t use a monolithic perspective to solve a multi-dimensional problem.<br>Ask yourself then, where are you coming from? Are you trying to reduce suffering? Or is it coming from pity? Even worse, through anger and vengeance?<br>Maybe it’s better to step back and look at yourself first. Perhaps it’s better to fix yourself than to try to fix the world’s problem.<br>Who’s knows, you probably might do it wrong!</p><hr><p>This section is an addition to the supporters of Marxism and rejection that Marxism is not the cause of Soviet Union. I am not in the position to refute the detailed points of Marxism as they are many more capable people then me to do that. But do understand that humans are fillable, we deviate from the orginal source to suit our own interest.<br>Here is a quote from the footnote of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/70561.The_Gulag_Archipelago_1918_1956" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Gulag Archipelago by Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn</a>. A Russian living in that era experiening first-hand the condition in the prisoner-of-war camps.</p><blockquote><p>The upper and the lower, the ruling and the ruled. This is a crude division, like all divisions, but if one classifies among the upper stratum not only those superior in power, money, and social position but also those superior in education, obtained through either family efforts or their own, in a world all those who do not need to work with their hands, then the division will be almost across the board.<br>Therefore we can expect four spheres of the world literature (and of art in general, and ideas in general). The first spheres: those in the upper stratum portraying (describing, pondering) the upper stratum, in other words themselves, their own people. The second spheres: the upper stratum depicting or pondering the lower stratum, “the younger brother”. The third sphere: the lower stratum depicting the upper. And the fourth: the lower stratum: the lower portraying… the lower. i.e, itself.<br>The upper stratum always had the free times, an excess or at least a sufficiency of means, the education, the training. Those among them who wanted to could always master the artistic techniques and the discipline of though. But there is one important law of life: Contentment always kill spiritual striving in a human being. And as a result this first sphere contained within it many satisfied artistic distortions and many morbid and self-important “schools” - satiated flowerings. And only when writers who were either profoundly unhappy in their personal lives or had an overwhelming natural drives toward spiritual seeking entered that sphere as the bearers of culture was  great literature created.<br>The fourth sphere is all the world’s folklore. Leisure time here was broken up into tiny pieces - and was available to individual in different ways. And the anonymous contributions to this culture also came in different ways. And premeditated, though lucky moments of glimpsing a perfected image or turn of speech. But the actual creators of it were innumerable, and they were almost always oppressed and dissatisfied people. Everything created then passed though selection, washing, polishing a hundred thousand times over, passing from mouth to mouth and year to year. And that is how we have come to among its authors there were none who were unacquainted with suffering. The written literature belonging to the fourth sphere (“proletarian”, “peasant”) is altogether embryonic, inexperienced, unsuccessful because individual knowing has always been lacking here.<br>The written literature of the third sphere (“looking upward from below”) suffered from the same faults of the inexperience, but even worse: it was poisoned by envy and hate - sterile feeling which do not create art. It made the same mistakes that revolutionaries continually make: ascribing the vices of the upper class to the class itself and to humanity as a whole, while failing to imagine how notable they themselves inherit these vices, Or else, on the other hand, it was spoiled by servile fawning.<br>Morally, the second sphere of literature promised to be the most fertile (“looking down from above”). It was created by people whose goodness, striving for the truth, and sense of justice had proved stronger than their soporific prosperity, and whose artistry was at the same time mature and on a high level. But the faults of the sphere was the incapacity genuinely to understand. These authors sympathized, pitied , wept, were indignant - and precisely because of this could not understand precisely. They simple could not climb into the pelts of the members of the lower stratum. And any who managed to get one leg over the fence could never get the other over.<br>Evidently man’s nature is so egocentric that this transformation can only take place, alas, with the help of external violence. This is how Cervantes got his education in slavery and Dostoyevsky his at hard labour. In the Gulag Archipelago this experiment was carried out on millions of heads and hearts all at once.</p></blockquote>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The truth could be replace as rational thought, common sense (although I would argue not very common sense), some empirical data, metaphor, or an analogy to prove a certain point. But which methodology is closer to the truth? Maybe there’s a voice at the back of your head telling you otherwise? Perhaps you’re using someone else thoughts as your own without justifying it?</p><p>The world is a complicated place beyond comprehension. We could possibly never have the capacity to understand the truth. We simplify, reduce, shorten the “truth” so could get our point across during a conversation/thought. To reach a point, we chain our thoughts into a sequential flow that makes sense. Imagine having someone break that chain of thought with another/opposing idea. Now you have to re-think. Now you have to have a debate to move forward. What if its something that has manifested in you so deeply close to your soul.  Will you pull the “Well, it’s up to your interpretation” card?  Aha! Someone caught you between your feet. You are not who you think you are. </p><p>We may not be adapted for truth. We’re tribal, biased, emotional, irrational creatures. You have to work tirelessly to get to the truth. It isn’t easy, especially when we’re unsure how to define truth.</p><p>How then?

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>There are places where we put ourselves in mentally on the idea of how we want to live our life. There is order; the place of comfort, the walls of culture, the perception of how society portrays your role according to your demographics, psychographic and ethnographic factors. Then, there is chaos, which is the land that lies outside the boundary of order. It is the place where the potential of exploration will take places. The area that elicits fear and curiosity. </p><p>Here’s an analogy to what I’m saying to visualise. You are on an island. The island is your reality. The things that lies within the island may or may not be enough for the capacity for living. And there’s the infinite ocean that surrounds the island. It is infinite because you cannot see the end of it. Therefore it is infinite. There are times where you don’t notice the ocean. There are times where you look at the sea, but the fear of exploration stops you. The fear of drowning. There are times where your fear is replaced by curiosity, and you step into the water. Everyone has their island, in different mental places.</p><p>The information that you feed yourselves is the foundation of your order, the sand below your feet. The island of order can shink and expand depending on the information you have so you move accordingly if you don’t want to drown and fall into nihilism. You have the move voluntarily; otherwise, you won’t move and you sink slowly and drown in your own reality. It a justified but sad way of living.</p>]]></content>

      <title>Thoughts on Rationally </title>

      <url>/2019/06/13/Thoughts-on-Rationally/</url>
      
        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>The question I want to contend with is that of human rationality. First, we have the define our terminology. What do we mean by rationality? I lack the knowledge of the philosophical perspective of rationality so I need to catch up on that in the future, but let us define rationality in terms in game theory. There are several axioms in game theory, but as a summary; if I get to choose between $1 and $2, I should pick $2 … obviously. The same logic should be applied to other scenarios or object with our initial logic. There might be a few problems here. Is this the same as Aristotelian’s logic? And what is the evolution of logic theory? Does the example suffice?</p><a id="more"></a><p>We can define rationally from another perspective. As conscience being, we are in control of our behaviour. There’s some problem with the definition here. We can say that there is a pre-define morality in every one of us that may be relative/absolute (We are not here to discuss this) or to put it in Kantian terms, a priori morality. Another view would be the existentialist view where it rejects the Kantian theory and expresses itself as existence before essence, men define men itself. We are responsible for our creation even though our environment, and psychological factor affects our behaviour, we choose our action and how we went to define ourselves. (Jean-Paul Sartre) Let’s say that our definition can compress all this view.</p><p>But we know for sure that sometimes our emotions can overcome our rationality. It may be the case where I’m angry and choose to have a lose-lose situation, but what I’m a referencing to is beyond that. Sometimes, we act against our will or something we act without thinking of the consequences. From the psychoanalysis (Freudian?)/Nietzschean view, we have to contend with our desires. It runs deep into our soul and springs out whenever it gets suppressed to a certain extent. Not only are we rational, but we are also irrational. We have contend to with Dionysus.</p><p>Here’s is where I turn to a more pragmatic view. We can build AI (artificial intelligence) in two different ways; the rule-based (ontological) or the pattern-based way (epistemology). We can look at the history of AI; the rule-based approach is unable to comprehend overly complicated problem because there are too many factors to consider (NP-Problem) and there are other subtle factors that are we’re not aware. We have resorted to the machine learning pattern-based approach. The problem lies on how to counter the inevitability of irrationally. How do we guide the machine to refute the probability of irrationally when we don’t understand consciousness ourselves? We can scale the problem down as a probability model on human behaviour, but our behaviour is a subset of our consciousness, we still need to tackle this problem, although it might not be a serious one now, it will be when we expect AI machine to run the world in the future.</p><p>Further Research/Reading </p><ul><li>Aristotle’s Logic </li><li>Post-Aristotle Classical Rationalism</li><li>Nietzsche’s The Birth of Tragedy - the dichotomy of Apollonian and Dionysian</li><li>Psychology of human behavior?</li><li>Psychology of irrationality?</li><li>Irrationality in game theory</li></ul>]]></content>

Right at the start of human consciousness, we express our creativity and try to conceptualize the world around us (back as earlier as 30,000 BCE). Archeologists discovery is in the material sense. The ideologies, ritual, practice is forever lost and up to the interpretation. As humans, we need to shelter ourselves. It could be that we simplify reality into symbolic representations, classify, categories, make it understandable so that the group can work towards the same goal?

Human’s creativity leads to the creation of new tools for cultivation. However, unlike today’s rational and empirical era, human attach mythological association to their figurative or geometric creations. There’s a divergence in society as human escape the confound of the cave and explore into different regions. Maybe it’s due to the limitation in our capacity to organise ourselves. At a certain threshold, groups split into different groups as they choose to cooperate or fight one another when encountered. </p><p>The idea of dichotomy can be found here where it probably has a cosmological meaning (sky and earth, masculine and feminine, etc.). This thinking has manifested itself in today’s philosophy as well. What worries me is the post-structuralist way where everything can be deconstructed and redefined. Is it possible that we could transcend our pre-modern thinking, or will it lead to a regression?

Back in the agriculture era, human worship the earth as Mother Nature and the source of harvesting. It is where the origin of life comes to be (association with the Mother’s womb). The caves and mines are a representation of the womb of Mother Earth. For metallurgy, the creation of the furnace opens up the new job possibility; the blacksmith. Now, human can perfect the ore, which means in a cosmological sense, men are now responsible for the creation of men. This can be interpreted as such; where the divine smiths forge the weapons of the gods and slay the dragon. In Egyptian version of the myth, Ptah (the potter god) forges the weapons and enable Hocus to conquer Seth. Hephaestus forges the thunderbolt that will enable Zeus to triumph over Typhon. The divine smith Tastr makes Indra’s weapons for his battle with Vrtra. This shift is ideas and beliefs are articulated around the trades of miners, metallurgists and smiths</p><h3 id="The-Mesopotamian-Religions"><a href="#The-Mesopotamian-Religions" class="headerlink" title="The Mesopotamian Religions"></a>The Mesopotamian Religions</h3><p>The Sumerian is said to be the earliest civilisation to document their myth. Here we have a story of the Enuma Elish where Dr Jordon Peterson used for his construction of symbolic representation in his book “Maps of Meaning”. The story flows like this: Tiamat (femininity) and Apsu(masculinity) are the primordial beings, representing the sea and mass of fresh water. From their mixture, other divine beings were born. As times passes, the tension between the gods grew and Apsu was executed. Tiamet reacted by forming monsters and bestow Kingu as their leader. Fearing defeat, the gods resort on sacrificing their power to rely on Marduk to confront Tiamat and Kingu. Marduk won the battle and created the world out of Tiamat’s organ. Finally, Maruk decides to create mankind from his blood for mankind shall service the gods.  </p><p>At Babylon, civilisation performs ritual closely resembling the Enuma Elish. With reference from Dr Jordan Peterson, civilisation forms into a hierarchy, but strangely the king is never at the top. He is still subordinate to the gods. On the day of a New Year, he expiates himself by declaring his innocence and is rewarded with a hierodule personifying as the goddess, metaphorically meaning the recreation of the world. The king is the personification of the gods that acts as a mediator between the world of men and the world of gods.</p><p>Here we can track the evolution of the religious idea. The Neolithic influences the Sumerian to an extent in terms of the patterns/narrative of the belief, and it’s passed further down to Greece thinking. The patterns stayed similar. However, the characters of the story defer. Why is that? (En-lil during Mesopotamia &gt; Marduk during Babylon &gt; Shamash) </p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>Enuma Elish </li><li>The Platonic Idea - preexistence of words and institutions </li><li>Flood Myth to symbolises a New Year (Story of Noah)</li><li>Epic of Gilgamesh</li></ul><h3 id="Egyptian-Civilisation"><a href="#Egyptian-Civilisation" class="headerlink" title="Egyptian Civilisation"></a>Egyptian Civilisation</h3><p>The Egyptian structure society as the centre of the world. If we look at the definition of Truth during this age. Truth is “Order” or “Good Justice”. What this means is whether law imposed on society, it is deemed as the Absolute Truth. We know during Mesopotamia age, civilisation structure is hierarchical, so is the Egyptian. At the top of the hierarchy, we have the pharaoh, the personification and mediator between man and god. Men can access the Absolute Truth through the pharaoh. Whether that is not the Truth is the symbolic representation of disorder, “chaos” or “Darkness.”</p><p>At a point, Egypt went through a civil war and the state collapsed, along with the collapse of the traditional values. The Egyptian descend into scepticism. There was a theme of agnosticism and pessimism that is the result of that scepticism. We can tell this from the writing during the time (The Song of the Harper, Dispute of a Man Weary of Life, etcetc.)  Here’s a description of the main mythological theme in Egypt as a result of this intermediation period. (explanation)</p><h3 id="Megalithic-Period"><a href="#Megalithic-Period" class="headerlink" title="Megalithic Period"></a>Megalithic Period</h3><p>In the Indian Myth, Men structure their life around the ‘banana’ when gods offer the fruit to Men. We can see a common similarity in how men structure themselves. The Object or Subject with a connection with a higher being is the main focus of society. Men define life with Truth, the association with God, and based their lives around this Object/Subject. What changes in the Megalithic period is that there is positive association with Death compared to the previous period. The ritual performed for Death is to ready the person for the transition into postexistence (whether it may be).</p><p>The most ancient cities (China, Mestomia, Egypt) build around sanctuaries, close to a sacred space, a “Center of the World| where communication between earth, heaven and the subterranean was deemed possible. We have several secularized civilization here. The Harappa is the first modern secularized civilization of India where we will focus on for the history of Hinduism. However, throughout a few centuries, the Harappan was attacked by Aryan Invaders. It synthesis the re-culturalization of mythological/religious phenomenon bough by the Aryan. This gave further influence during the Hellenic age.</p><p>List of ritual Acts/Beliefs</p><ul><li>Stonehenge </li><li>Myth of the Minotaur</li><li>Hinduism </li></ul>]]></content>

I can programme, especially javascript stuff — been participating in hackathon to further my skills and expose myself into the startup ecosystem. Right now I’m contemplating about life, a shared endeavour of people roughly the same age as me. So that was this website for. To contemplate. Here’s a summary I wrote a few months ago in case I were to create a platform to share my thought </p><p>I’m using this platform to formulate my throughs. I realised that understanding a topic implicitly and expressing it explicitly are two different nature. The problem for me when trying to explain something is 1. there were gaps in my knowledge 2. the other individual has a pre-supposition that is different from mine.</p>]]></content>
